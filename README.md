# 42-School---Piscine
Reproductions of the exercises done during Piscine process on 42 School.
This projects have very tight norms regarding format and more than anything, limits on what functions can be used.
Some of the format guidelines are not followed in this repository, if you try to copy this exercises without editing them, they wont pass "Norminette".
Some of the most important (but not all) that i will adhere to and will give context for the projects in this repository are:

    -Only While() loops are allowed, Do Wile() and For() are out of bounds.
    -Write() is the only function allowed to show information on terminal.
    -switch() statements are forbidden.
    -Functions must not have more than 4 arguments.
    -There is a 5 functions limit per project, not including Main, as is likely to be provided during the correction. (this is why most of them will be comented.)
    -Malloc() and Free() are the only other functions under a .h allowed, and only if specified by the project.
